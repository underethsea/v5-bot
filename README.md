# v5-bot

## this is a WIP!! 
It has no pricing implemented yet and is pulling a faulty list of Poolers from Covalent. Pricing can be implemented many ways and some of the tools are there. playersSubgraph.js is the WIP fix for the Poolers.

`yarn`

copy .env.example to .env

put keys in .env

update config.js

`node claimer.js`

`node liquidator.js`

a new deployment can be added in constants/address.js

when starting out you will need to uncomment the approve logic on liquidator.js
